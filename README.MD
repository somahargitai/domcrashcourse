_it is just a micro project to learn DOM usage, following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/0ik6X4DJKCc)_

Use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in Visual Studio Code, start [F12 inspector tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) and its __console__ in your browser, and play with uncommenting lines. Modern frameworks will help you a lot about DOM manipulation, but it is still a must to know it in depth, also the inspector dev tools which can be found in all the modern browsers.
